Manage BIG-IP Clusters with F5 LBaaSv2
======================================

Overview
--------

The F5速 LBaaSv2 agent and driver can manage BIG-IP速 :term:`device service clusters`, providing :term:`high availability`, :term:`mirroring`, and :term:`failover` services within your OpenStack cloud.

The F5 agent applies LBaaS configuration changes to each BIG-IP :term:`device` in a cluster at the same time, in real time. It is unnecessary to use BIG-IP's '`configuration synchronization`_ mode' to sync LBaaS objects managed by the agent across the devices in a cluster.

Clustering provides a greater degree of redundancy than a standalone device offers. It helps to avoid service interruptions that could otherwise occur if a device should go down. F5 LBaaSv2 can manage BIG-IP `Sync-Failover device groups`_ when set to use either the :term:`pair` or the :term:`scalen` :ref:`High Availability mode <HA mode>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Basic understanding of `BIG-IP速 device service clustering <https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-device-service-clustering-admin-12-0-0.html>`_.

- Licensed, operational BIG-IP :term:`device service cluster`.

    .. tip::

        If you do not already have a BIG-IP cluster deployed in your network, you can use the `F5 BIG-IP: Active-Standby Cluster <http://f5-openstack-heat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/templates/supported/ref_f5-plugins_active-standby.html>`_ Heat template to create a two-device cluster.

- Operational OpenStack cloud (|openstack| release).

- Administrator access to both BIG-IP devices and OpenStack cloud.

- F5 :ref:`agent <agent:home>` and :ref:`service provider driver <Install the F5 LBaaSv2 Driver>` installed on the Neutron controller and all other hosts from which you want to provision LBaaS services.


Caveats
-------

- The F5 agent can manage clusters of two (2) to four (4) BIG-IP devices. Active-standby mode can only be used with two (2) devices; scalen is used with clusters of more than two devices.

- The administrator login must be the same on all BIG-IP devices in the cluster.

Configuration
-------------

1. Edit the :ref:`Agent Configuration File`:

.. code-block:: text

    $ sudo emacs /etc/neutron/services/f5/f5-openstack-agent.ini


2. Set the :ref:`HA mode` to :term:`pair` or :term:`scalen`.

.. code-block:: text
    :emphasize-lines: 10

    # HA mode
    #
    # Device can be required to be:
    #
    # standalone - single device no HA
    # pair - active-standby two device HA
    # scalen - active device cluster
    #
    #
    f5_ha_type = pair
    #
    #

3. Add the IP address for each BIG-IP device, the admin username, and the admin password to the :ref:`Device Driver - iControl速 Driver Setting <Device Driver Settings / iControl Driver Settings>` section of the config file. Values must be comma-separated.

.. code-block:: text
    :emphasize-lines: 10

    #
    icontrol_hostname = 10.190.7.232,10.190.4.193
    #
    icontrol_username = admin
    #
    icontrol_password = admin
    #

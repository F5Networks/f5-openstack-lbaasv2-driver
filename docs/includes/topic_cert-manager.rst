Certificate Manager
===================

Overview
--------

OpenStack's 'Barbican' certificate manager provides a secure location where users can store sensitive information, such as SSH keys, private keys, certificates, and user passwords (referred to as "`secrets`_ " in OpenStack lingo).

The F5速 agent allows users to use their Barbican certificates in conjunction with :term:`SSL offloading`, shifting client authentication and encryption/decryption tasks from the target server. It also allows users to designate an existing BIG-IP速 SSL profile as the parent from which all client profiles created in OpenStack inherit settings.

Use Case
--------

In general, SSL offloading increases server and application capacity by moving authentication processing from the target server to a designated authentication server. When you configure  certificate manager in your OpenStack cloud, you can create LBaaS listeners that use the ``TERMINATED_HTTPS`` protocol for TLS/SSL termination. If you have already defined SSL profiles on your BIG-IP, you can designate one as the parent profile from which all of the client SSL profile settings will be inherited.

- ``cert_manager``: The certificate manager that manages access to certificates and keys for user authentication. Must be set to ``f5_openstack_agent.lbaasv2.drivers.bigip.barbican_cert.BarbicanCertManager``.

- Keystone v2/v3 authentication

    - ``auth_version``: Keystone version (``v2`` or ``v3``)
    - ``os_auth_url``: Keystone authentication URL
    - ``os_username``: OpenStack username
    - ``os_password``: OpenStack password
    - ``os_tenant_name``: OpenStack tenant name (v2 only)
    - ``os_user_domain_name``: OpenStack domain in which the user account resides (v3 only)
    - ``os_project_name``: OpenStack project name (v3 only; refers to the same data as ``os_tenant_name`` in v2)
    - ``os_project_domain_name``: OpenStack domain in which the project resides
    - ``f5_parent_ssl_profile``: The parent SSL profile on the BIG-IP速 from which the agent SSL profile should inherit settings

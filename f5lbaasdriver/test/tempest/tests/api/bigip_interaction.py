"""Module for test-based interactions with the BIG-IP

    This module offers classes and methods that can be used to interact with
    the BIG-IP's configuration.  As a part of this, tests can peform necessary
    standup and teardown actions.

    Upon teardown, if the module discoves a diff between the snap-shotted copy
    of the BIG-IP's starting config and the post-test config, then a diff file
    is generated.  This diff file is generated using linux's `which diff` app.

    The format of the file and the file's location depends upon the test
    instance and the test's name as follows:
        /tmp/tempest_bigip_<test>_<year><month><day><hour><minute><second>.diff
    Example:
        /tmp/tempest_bigip_test_foo_20170703222336.diff
        or 2017/07/03 22:23:36 or 10:23:36 PM on Jul 3 2017
    The time is derived during compile time of the tests, not during runtime.
    This assures that all diff files generated during a single test run have
    the same timestamp in the filename; thus, it is expected that some files
    may not have the same creation date epoch as the timestamp in the filename.
